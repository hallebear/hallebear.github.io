I like to run and skate! I have three brothers. I like to shop at Abercrombie and Fitch, Aeropostale,and Ivvia! My family takes lots of vacations together and we always have fun! I like playing with friends and my brothers! I run track for Woodbury and Lake Middle school! I figure skate for Woodbury too, but I also just skate for fun with my friends and family!I also like drawing and listening to music in my room. Another one of my hobbies is singing! I sing for school and church!
